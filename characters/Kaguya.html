            <p>
                 Princess Kaguya Ōtsutsuki is the former matriarch of the Ōtsutsuki clan, the former partner of Isshiki Ōtsutsuki and mother of Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki. Long before the founding of the hidden villages, during an era of endless war, Kaguya consumed the fruit of the God Tree and became the first wielder of chakra on Earth, before later merging with the tree to become the Ten-Tails.
